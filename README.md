# React-TodoApp
I used Django and React to make this TODO application. A user can add new tasks, view tasks, edit existing tasks and delete tasks.
 
Each task has a name, a short desciption and can be marked as complete or incomplete.

This is my first app using the React framework. I followed a tutorial found here:
https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react/Amp

Description from the tutorial:
"Django and React make an awesome combination to build this application with, owing to React’s SPA optimizations, and Django’s long list of helpful libraries. For this application to work correctly, the frontend (React) will have to interact with the backend i.e retrieve and store data. To create the interface for interaction, we will build an API (Application Programming Interface) on the backend, using the Django REST framework (DRF)."
